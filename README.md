This project is for the Heroes vs Villain game for CT1207.

Team members: Raphael, Gr√©goire, Maxime and Yahia.

--------------------------------------------------------
The team consists of four members: a warrior, a hunter, a mage and a healer. The waves of villains
are made up of 3 then 4 then 5 trolls and a last wave where there is a dragon. The game is won if
the team defeats the dragon.


In each round of combat:

- The warrior chooses an opponent and makes him lose up to 5 life points.
- The hunter chooses an opponent and makes him lose up to 3 life points. He starts a wave
with 5 arrows and shoots one arrow per turn. If he has no more arrows, he only makes up to
1 life point damage.
- The healer chooses a team member and makes him gain 2 life points, then he chooses an
opponent and makes him lose 1 life point at most.
- Only for teams of 4 students:
The mage chooses an opponent and makes him lose up to 4 life points and also up to 2 life
points for all other opponents.
- A troll causes the team member who attacked him to lose up to 4 life points, except for the
hunter who only loses up to 2 life points.
- The dragon causes the team member who attacked him to lose up to 6 life points and the
other team members also lose up to 2 life points.

The number of life points lost is a random value between zero and the "up to" maximum. Each hero
starts with 10 life points, each troll with 5, and the dragon with 15.
